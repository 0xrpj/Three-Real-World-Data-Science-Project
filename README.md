# Three Real-World Data Science Project


## Brief Introduction

If we want to become a data scientist or we want to do characterization as a data scientist, then we have to showcase our practical skills because theory skills is not what helps us until we do not have any particular practical skills. So the best way to showcase our practical skills by solving some real life challenges, by solving real-world use cases. That's why in the repo, I have come up with three real-world challenges of Machine Learning, Time-series Analysis use case, Natural Language Processing in a much more efficient way.

## Predict Flight Fare Detection

So, the very first use case is exactly of Machine Learning on which I am to cover the use case of Airline Industry. Basically, I have to analyze that huge chunk of data and from that data, I have to extract some meaningful insights.

Some meaningful insight of that, I have found:

* What exactly can be the future of airlines on different sources.
* What exactly the arrival time of that particular flight or what is a departure time
* What exactly the data journey

So, considering all the meaningful insight, I have to predict what can be the field of airlines with respect to a particular day. I know this project will be very handy and it will definitely help me out to understand every feature of data.

Task I have done to find the meaningful insight of data

* Understanding data and data pre-preprocessing
* Extract derived features from data
* Perform data pre-processing
* Handle categorical data and feature encoding
* Perform label encoding on data
* Outlier Detection
* Select the best feature using the feature selection technique
* Applying random forest on data and automate predictions
* Play with multiple algorithms (Decision Tree and k - Nearest Neighbors)
* Cross validate the model

## Predict Strength of Password (Natural Language Processing (NLP) use case

So, the second use case is exactly of Natural Language Processing on which I am going to predict what actually can be the strength of the password, whether it is a strong category, whether it is of average category or whether it a poor category.

Let's say a user is going to do sign up on any other social media and in the process of sign up, he or she has to fill in a password. So at the time of filling password, the system has to predict whatever the user is going to fill on a particular social media. System have to predict what type of category of password is alive, whether it is a strong password, average category, or weak category. So, to build a model, I have to do lots of data preprocessing, also lots of analysis of data. Because I have to understand my data as much as I can. After that, I have to apply lots of techniques of Natural Language of Processing as well as Machine Learning algorithms on data.

Task I have done to find the meaningful insight of data "password"

* Exploring our data
* Apply TF-IDF on data
* Apply Logistic Regression on data
* Predict Password users password
* Checking accuracy of the model
* Model hyperparameter tuning
